    "description": "The NetSuite connector allows you to access the exposed API through the WSO2 ESB. SuiteTalk exposes NetSuite as a data source for programmatic access. Most of the data operations developers expect such as insert, update, delete, and select/search are supported. There are also a number of operations that are available as supporting operations for data read/write operations. With the SuiteTalk platform, you can integrate existing business functions within your organization to NetSuite through the use of Web services. Web services can be invoked in real-time to perform operations such as retrieving, adding, updating, and deleting data. The connector uses the NetSuite SOAP API reference (Web services standard operation).",
